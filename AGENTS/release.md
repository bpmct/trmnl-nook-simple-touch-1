# Release notes (agent guidance)

This document is **for agents to assist users** when they inevitably ask
“how do I cut a release?”. The agent should **not** perform release steps
unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Release flow (tags + GitHub Actions)

Releases are driven by tags like `v0.1.0`. The CI workflow
`build-apk.yml` stamps the manifest version, builds a signed release APK,
and publishes a GitHub Release with the APK attached.

### Safety guards (automated)

- **versionCode regression check** — `set-version.sh` compares the computed
  versionCode against the previous tag's manifest and **fails the build** if
  it hasn't increased. This prevents releasing a tag with a stale or duplicate
  versionCode.
- **Tag moves to version-bumped commit** — After CI commits the version bump
  to `main`, it force-pushes the tag to that commit. This ensures
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../v0.9.4/AndroidManifest.xml` serves the
  correct version (not the pre-bump snapshot). Without this, downstream
  consumers (e.g. `bpmct/nooks`) that read the manifest from the tag ref
  would see stale version info.

### Versioning nuance (when to bump major/minor/patch)

This project follows semantic-versioning *in spirit*:

- **Patch** (`0.x.Y`) for small fixes that should be low risk.
- **Minor** (`0.X.0`) when changes are significant, user-visible, or may affect
  server compatibility / settings (even if backwards compatible).
- **Major** (`X.0.0`) only for truly breaking changes.

In practice: if you find yourself writing release notes that include multiple
new capabilities, settings, or networking behavior changes, prefer a **minor**
bump so users expect meaningful change.

Suggested guidance to give users:
- Ensure `main` is clean and up to date.
- **Do NOT run `set-version.sh` locally or commit version bumps.** CI stamps
  the manifest automatically from the tag and commits the bump back to `main`.
  Running it locally creates a misleading versionCode that diverges from the release.
- Create and push the tag **on `main`**:
  - `git tag v0.1.0`
  - `git push origin main --tags`
- Wait for the **tag** CI run (not the branch run). Both trigger, but only the
  tag run (`refs/tags/v*`) creates the GitHub Release. Use `gh run list` and
  look for the run with the tag ref (e.g., `v0.1.0`), then `gh run watch <id>`.
- After CI completes, update release notes with a "What's New" section:
  ```
  gh release edit v0.1.0 --notes "## What's New

  - **Feature name** - Brief description of the change, explaining what was wrong and how it's fixed."
  ```
  Use past tense for fixes ("Fixed X") and describe both the problem and solution.
